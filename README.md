# LoL_Early_Game_Win_Prediction

This project predicts match outcomes in high-rank League of Legends games using early-game features (first 10 minutes).

Main Techniques:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- XGBoost Modeling
- Hyperparameter Tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)
- SHAP Model Interpretability

Key Results:
- Achieved ~72% F1-Score and ~80% ROC-AUC
- Identified gold and experience advantages as primary win predictors

Future work includes adding time-series dynamics, more complex features, and possible model ensembles.
